The Petris game is a variation of the Tetris game, in which we have N columns of
coloured stones, numbered from 1 to N. Every moment, a new stone comes from above
and the player can move it in a way it falls at the top of one of the N columns,
or start a new column in the left or the right of the rest. Each time a stone of
color C is added at the top of the column above another stone of identical color,
every stone of the same color C is removed from the top of this column. When a 
column becomes empty, it is removed and all columns to the left are moved one
position to the right, to fill in the gap.
The objective is to maintain the total number of stones and columns the less as
possible.

For instance, let's suppose the current game configuration is as follows,
each color being represented by a number:


    2
1 2 1 0 2
0 1 2 2 1 1
----------- <-- base
1 2 3 4 5 6 <-- column number

If a stone of color 2 is added to column 2, we'll have:

  2 2
1 2 1 0 2
0 1 2 2 1 1
-----------
1 2 3 4 5 6 

And then

    2
1   1 0 2
0 1 2 2 1 1
-----------
1 2 3 4 5 6 

If, after that, a stone of color 1 is added to the same column, we'll stay with:

    2
1 1 1 0 2
0 1 2 2 1 1
-----------
1 2 3 4 5 6 

and therefore

    2
1   1 0 2
0   2 2 1 1
-----------
1 2 3 4 5 6 

making the column 2 disappear, finishing finally with:
  2
1 1 0 2
0 2 2 1 1
---------
1 2 3 4 5 





---Input format---

The first line of input consists of a integer

P

corresponding to the number of games to be evaluated

Each game is represented by a sequence of moves, and each one corresponds to the addition of a new stone, in the following form:

S[0] C[0]
S[1] C[1]
...
S[M] C[M]
END

where

- 0 <= S[i] <= N+1: indicates the column in which the stone is added, being N the current number of columns. If S[i] is 0, a new column must be added at the left. If S[i] equals N+1m a new column must be added to the right.
 
- C[i] indicates the color of the stone to be added

The end of each game is indicated by a line "END" followed by a blank line.

---Output Format---

For each game k=0,...,P-1 at the input, must be printed a line in the form:

```
case k: T[1] T[2] ... T[N]
```

where

- N is the total number of columns at the end of the game, and

- T[j] is the color of the stone at the top of the column j, for j=1,...,N
